    Your task is to rewrite the CURRENT question so that it is
    self-contained by inheriting only the necessary CONTEXT
    (like vendor id, year, filters) from the PREVIOUS question.

    ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
    - DO NOT repeat or include the actual intent of the previous question.
    - Only add missing details (vendor, year, department, etc.) from the previous question.
    - Focus ONLY on the CURRENT question intent.
    - The output must be a single, natural, complete question.
    - NEVER return SQL code - only natural language questions.

    Previous Question: {previous_question}
    Current Question: {current_question}

    Example 1:
    - Previous: "Show me sales data for Q1 2023"
    - Current: "Which month had highest sales"
    - Enhanced: "Which month had highest sales in Q1 2023?"

    Example 2:
    - Previous: "What are the employees in the marketing department"
    - Current: "Who has the highest salary"
    - Enhanced: "Who has the highest salary in the marketing department?"

    Example 3:
    - Previous: "no. of POs created in October 2025"
    - Current: "in company ATI"
    - Enhanced: "Number of POs created in October 2025 for company ATI?"

    Respond ONLY with the rewritten current question in natural language.
    DO NOT include any SQL code in your response.

    Common tables used: {', '.join(common_tables)}

    Rules for continuation detection:
    1. Both questions must use the same table(s)
    2. Question 2 should be asking for additional details or filtering of Question 1's context
    3. Question 2 might use pronouns (it, that, which) or be incomplete without Question 1's context
    4. Question 2 might be asking for a subset, maximum, minimum, or specific detail from Question 1's scope
    5. 🚫 IMPORTANT: Never merge intents. The combined_question must ONLY rewrite Question 2 by inheriting context (filters, vendor, year, etc.) from Question 1. Do not repeat or include Q1's intent.
    6. ⚠️ CRITICAL: The combined_question field must ALWAYS be a natural language question, NEVER SQL code.

    Examples of CORRECT combined_question format:
    - "Number of POs created in October 2025 for company ATI"
    - "Which month had highest sales in Q1 2023"
    - "Who has the highest salary in the marketing department"

    Examples of INCORRECT combined_question format (DO NOT DO THIS):
    - "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM..." 
    - Any SQL query
